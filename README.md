# VS Code - Image Diff(erence)

This is a small extension for VS Code to compare to images and detect small differences.

> Inspiration for this extension was my computer graphics course at KIT, where we had to render images and the expected result image was already provided.
If the task was correctly implemented, there were no differences.

## Features

You can compare two images directly in VS Code using side by side:

![Side by side comparison of two images](docs/images/side_by_side.png)

Here you cant really see the difference between the images. (It is off by one pixel.)
Now **Image Diff** comes into play:

You are able to zoom to detect small differences.
